Deprecated support for empty usernames. Now all backends will reject an empty string as input for the 'username' field when setting a password. Later this deprecation will become a more visible user warning and even later an error. If this warning is triggered in your environment, please consider using a static value (even 'username') or comment in the issue and describe the use-case that demands support for empty usernames.
